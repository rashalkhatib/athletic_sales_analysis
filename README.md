Athletic Sales Analysis

This project aims to analyze sales data to gain insights into which cities in the U.S. have sold the most athletic wear over two years. Additionally, the analysis will determine which retailers had the greatest total sales for athletic wear, identify the retailers that sold the most women's athletic footwear, and pinpoint the days and weeks with the highest sales for women's athletic footwear.
